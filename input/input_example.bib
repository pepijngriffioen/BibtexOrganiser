   abstract = {Process models are an important means to capture information on organizational operations and often represent the starting point for process analysis and improvement. Since the manual elicitation and creation of process models is a time-intensive endeavor, a variety of techniques have been developed that automatically derive process models from textual process descriptions. However, these techniques, so far, only focus on the extraction of traditional, imperative process models. The extraction of declarative process models, which allow to effectively capture complex process behavior in a compact fashion, has not been addressed. In this paper we close this gap by presenting the first automated approach for the extraction of declarative process models from natural language. To achieve this, we developed tailored Natural Language Processing techniques that identify activities and their inter-relations from textual constraint descriptions. A quantitative evaluation shows that our approach is able to generate constraints that closely resemble those established by humans. Therefore, our approach provides automated support for an otherwise tedious and complex manual endeavor.},

   abstract = {Process Modeling has been a very active research topic for the last decades. One of its main issues is the externalization of knowledge and its acquisition for further use, as this remains deeply related to the quality of the resulting process models produced by this task. This paper presents a method and a graphical supporting tool for process elicitation and modeling, combining the Group Storytelling technique with the advances of Text Mining and Natural Language Processing. The implemented tool extends its previous versions with several functionalities to facilitate group story telling by the users, as well as to improve the results of the acquired process model from the stories.},

   abstract = {During the last years, it has been noticed a growing interest of organizations in improving their business processes in order to be more competitive in a globalized economy that passes nowadays through a severe financial crisis with restrictive market conditions and limited profit margins. The first step in achieving this goal is to use an adequate business process modeling language to represent their business processes. For this purpose, an evaluation of the existing business process modeling languages would be very useful in making the right decision. Our research work comes to supplement the previous researches that have evaluated business process modeling languages. The evaluation performed in this paper is focused on the two most widely used graphical notations for business processes: Business Process Modeling and Notation (BPMN) and UML Activity Diagram (UML AD). The evaluation criteria are: capacity of being readily understandable, adequacy of the graphical elements of BPMN and UML AD to represent the real business processes of an organization and mapping to Business Process Execution Languages. The results of evaluating BPMN and UML AD against each of these three criteria are presented in the paper.},
